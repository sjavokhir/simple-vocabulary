## Built With ðŸ› 

- [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) - Jetpack Compose is Androidâ€™s modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android. Quickly bring your app to life with less code, powerful tools, and intuitive Kotlin APIs.
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) - First class and official programming language for Android development.
- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - For asynchronous and more..
- [Flow](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines.flow/-flow/) - A cold asynchronous data stream that sequentially emits values and completes normally or with an exception.
- [StateFlow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow/stateflow-and-sharedflow) - StateFlow is a state-holder observable flow that emits the current and new state updates to its collectors.
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
    - [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.
- [Dependency Injection](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection) -
    - [Hilt-Dagger](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) - Standard library to incorporate Dagger dependency injection into an Android application.
    - [Hilt-ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-jetpack) - DI for injecting `ViewModel`.
- [Room](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/room) - an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
- [Material 3](https://m3.material.io/) - Make personal devices feel personal with Material Design 3, Google's most expressive and adaptable design system yet.
- [Compose Navigation](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation) - The Navigation component provides support for Jetpack Compose applications. You can navigate between composables while taking advantage of the Navigation componentâ€™s infrastructure and features.
- [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/compose/) - An image loading library for Android backed by Kotlin Coroutines.
